# RDCAM
A repository to contribute on a Open Source version of the (un)popular LaserWorks RDCAM (from Shenzhen Reader Technology Co., Ltd.). Also I plan to reverse engineer the board (RDLC-320-A)

**WARNING:** The RDCAM software is property of `Shenzhen Reader Technology Co., Ltd.`, I publish some of their software here and I reverse engineer their software, but I'm not copying any code from they. The GPLv2 part will be made from scratch.
